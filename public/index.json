The present data depict a time series of a network of individuals involved in the 2004 Australian Embassy Bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia. This undirected network is composed of 25 individuals and their relationships and legal status over time (1985-1989, 1990-1994, 1995-1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007). Relationships are coded into two categories: general relationships and kinship. General relationships are coded on a scale of 0-3; ‘0’ represents no relationship known (as such these relationships are not included in the cleaned data), ‘1’ represents acquaintanceship or distant family ties, ‘2’ represents friendship or moderately close family ties, ‘3’ represents close friends or family.

The present data set represents a reconstruction of the data presented in the original paper, Inferring missing links in partially observed social network, put together by the UCINET team. The data refers to a specific temporal window which runs from 1975 to 2002, and represents 22 members N17 with data derived from open-source reporting. The data set codes relationships between 22 members of N17, each tie is coded as ‘1’. The data set includes three attributes of the 22 members of N17, which include: role, faction, and resources. Role is coded with ‘1’ denoting giving orders, and ‘2’ denoting a person who recieves orders. Both faction and resources are coded from 1 to 3. Attributes for factions are coded as: ‘1’ representing the 1st Generation Leadership Faction, ‘2’ representing the Koufontinas Faction, ‘3’ representing the Sardanopoulos Faction. Resources attributes are coded as: ‘1’ for controlling one resource, ‘2’ for controlling two resources, and ‘3’ for controlling three resources.\n Abstract Commonly when working with large social networks, data collection is limited by resources, time, and accessibility to the network leading connections to be missed. As demonstrated in the article, Inferring missing links in partially observed social networks authored by CJ Rhodes and P Jones, it is possible to infer social network topology following a limited observation of a large network, despite data collection constraints. Inferences can be made to determine where previously unconnected individuals are likely to fit, thereby attempting to predict network growth as new people are considered for inclusion. The structure of a covert network or one that is actively trying to remain undetected can be even more difficult to ascertain. However, as with the case of the 17 November Revolutionary Organization (N17), a militant Marxist urban guerrilla organization in Greece, it can be very useful to understand the likelihood that individuals are connected despite limited or no evidence of a link. The missing-links in the N17 network were reconstructed using a statistical procedure based on Bayes’ Theorem, using data derived from open-source reporting between 1975 to 2002, a time period in which the group was responsible for several violent acts such as assassinations, kidnappings, and symbolic attacks on government offices. The Bayesian approach used in this study determined the probability of an interaction between individuals based on a sample of their known relationships to other N17 associates when examined against their known relationships, role within the group, membership to factions, access to resources necessary to conduct group operations, and centrality (or importance) to the N17 network. The results of the statistical analysis captures a predictive estimate of the possibility of connections between individuals that were not initially detected during the initial network sampling. To increase confidence in the inference method, the study repeated the analysis on several other independent network samples drawn from the N17 data, ultimately exhibiting that there is a 50% probability that these predicted links are correct.\n Code Book   edge_class is_bimodal is_directed is_dynamic is_weighted definition    connection FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Relations indicate that open source reporting has demonstrated some connection between the two individuals at some point in the past.

Of the 67 individuals, 55 have been categorized as Anabaptists. The data was obtained from the article, “Factors of Religious Violence and Path to Peace: A Study of the 16th Century Anabaptists,” (McLaughlin, J 2015), a Master’s Thesis at the Naval Postgraduate School, but was originally curated for use in the article, “Cultural inheritance or cultural diffusion of religious violence? A quantitative case study of the Radical Reformation,” (Matthews, Edmons, Wildman, Nunn, 2013). This data accounts for a variety of node attributes including if the individual is a believer in Baptist theology, sanctions violence, participated in the Munster Rebellion, believes in apocalyptic theology, and an Anabaptist or Lutheran. Furthermore, accounted for is an individual’s origin and the location they are based in, and their participation in each specific religious sect (Melchiorite-Hofmannite, Hut-Austrian, Swiss Brethren, Denck-South German, Hutterite, reformed Lutheran, other Prodestant, and tradition). Ties represent that individuals had met at least once, but does not signify agreement or disagreements in theology.\n Abstract Historically, organized religion has been associated with large-scale cooperative activities- sometimes including the use of violence against groups of religious outsiders. Originally used in the article, “Cultural inheritance or cultural diffusion of religious violence? A quantitative case study of the Radical Reformation,” (Matthews, Edmons, Wildman, Nunn, 2013), a network of sixteenth-century Anabaptist were created to understand how religious violence diffused through the congregations. Almost half of the congregations represented groups advocating for the use of violence to overthrow established churches and governments toward the ultimate goal of establishing Christian theocracies, with the other half being pacifists. Actors and their stances on violence in the network were defined and coded based on their appearances within Anabaptist literature, and systematic collection of states for Anabaptist denominations. The authors used a number of statistical analyses to determine that violent ideology may be learned independently from most other characteristics of an overall belief system, and/or may be determined more by congregationally inherited economic and political factors than by theology (Matthews, 2013). The data was expanded from 49 to 67 leaders with documented ties during its use in “Factors of Religious Violence and Path to Peace: A Study of the 16th Century Anabaptists,” (McLaughlin, J 2015) to include Anabaptist and Prodestant leaders that were influential during the Protestant Reformation and the Radical Reformation that have documented interactions. Documented interactions between individuals include instances of the actors meeting each other, or were in conversation, but in many cases, the leaders worked together, or went to school together.

Of the 67 individuals, 55 have been categorized as Anabaptists. The data was obtained from the article, “Factors of Religious Violence and Path to Peace: A Study of the 16th Century Anabaptists,” (McLaughlin, J 2015), a Master’s Thesis at the Naval Postgraduate School, but was originally curated for use in the article, “Cultural inheritance or cultural diffusion of religious violence? A quantitative case study of the Radical Reformation,” (Matthews, Edmons, Wildman, Nunn, 2013). This data accounts for a variety of node attributes including if the individual is a believer in Baptist theology, sanctions violence, participated in the Munster Rebellion, believes in apocalyptic theology, and an Anabaptist or Lutheran. Furthermore, accounted for is an individual’s origin and the location they are based in, and their participation in each specific religious sect (Melchiorite-Hofmannite, Hut-Austrian, Swiss Brethren, Denck-South German, Hutterite, reformed Lutheran, other Prodestant, and tradition). Ties represent that individuals had met at least once, but does not signify agreement or disagreements in theology.\n Abstract Historically, organized religion has been associated with large-scale cooperative activities- sometimes including the use of violence against groups of religious outsiders.

The two ICG reports on Noordin contain rich one- and two-mode data on a variety of relations and affiliations (friendship, kinship, meetings, etc.) along with significant attribute data (education, group membership, physical status, etc.). The data were initially structured and analyzed by Naval Postgraduate School students in the course “Tracking and Disrupting Dark Networks” under the direction of Professor Sean Everton, Co-Director of the CORE Lab and Professor Nancy Roberts and then expanded and cleaned by Associate Faculty for Instruction, Dan Cunningham.\n Code Book   edge_class is_bimodal is_directed is_dynamic is_weighted definition    Organizations (Orgs) TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Terrorist/Insurgent and Affiliated Organizations: A terrorist/insurgent organization is defined as an administrative and functional system, whose primary common goal is the operational conduct of terrorist/insurgent activities, consisting of willingly affiliated claimant members. For the purpose of this exercise, factions and offshoots will be considered separate from their parent organization in order to prevent from coding redundant ties. In other words, the most micro-level affiliations are coded while an individual is only coded in the parent organization if he or she is not listed as being affiliated with a component organization. Terrorist/insurgent affiliated organizations, such MMI and FPI, are also coded in this matrix.  Education (Schools) TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Educational Relations: Educational relations are defined as schools where individuals receive formal education, serve as an employee (teacher, admin etc.), and/or involved in additional educational or religious instruction at the institution.  Classmates FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Classmate Relations:Classmates/educational colleagues are defined as individuals who receive formal education, serve as an employee (teacher, admin etc.), and/or involved in additional educational or religious instruction at the same institution and at the same time. This relationship is more likely to reflect accurate relationships than the two-mode “Educational Affiliation” matrix since it considers the time in which individuals are present at a school.  Communication Ties FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Internal Communication: Internal communication is defined as the relaying of messages between individuals and/or groups inside the network through some sort of medium.  Kinship Ties FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Kinship: Kinship is defined as any family connection such as brother, brother-in-law, nephew etc. Kinship will also include current marriages and past marriages due to divorces and/or deaths.  Training Events TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Training Relations: Participation in any specifically designated activity that teaches the knowledge, skills, and competencies of terrorism and insurgency. Training does not include participation in a terrorist sponsored act or mujahedeen activity in places such as Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, or Iraq unless the individuals’ presence was to participate in a specifically designated training camp or base in one of these areas.  Business \u0026amp; Finance TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Business Relations: Defined as profit and non-profit organizations that employ people (includes Durassalam Foundation).  Operations TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Operations: Operational relations are defined as individuals who are knowingly involved in preparing, executing, and/or providing post-operation support. Preparation must directly relate to the operation and can include surveying targets, providing a safehouse for preparation, contributing to religious and/or physical training, and participating in a robbery where proceeds fund a subsequent attack. Providing post-operation support, such as hiding fugitives and disposing of explosives, must also be directly related to the operation.  Friendship Ties FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Friendship Relations: Friendship relations are defined as close attachments through affection or esteem between two people. Friendship ties are not defined solely as meetings and/ or school ties.  Religious Affiliation TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Religious Relations: Religious relations are defined as an association with a mosque, church, synagogue or religious study circle. Religious study circles are only coded if they are separate from other religious entities (i.e. mosque). We do not include Islamic schools even though we assume that the schools have mosques. Not using the schools prevents duplication of effort with the team constructing the school ties. Additionally, we listed the mosques by the town in which it is located. If there was more than one in a city, we added a numerical identifier plus the name of nearest location.  Soulmates FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Soulmate Relations: Soulmate relations are defined as individuals who are affiliated with the same religious institution at the same time. This relationship is more likely to indicate accurate religious ties than the “religious affiliation” since it considers the timeframes in which individuals are affiliated with religious institutions.  Logistical Place TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Logistical Relations: Logistical relations are defined to mean a Key Place within the archipelago where logistical activity occurred. Logistical activity is defined as providing “safe houses” for meeting/hiding, providing material support in terms of explosives, providing weaponry, or facilitating transportation of personnel or equipment.  Logistical Function TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Logistic Functions: Logistical functions are defined as the support for terrorist/insurgency operations by providing materials, weapons, transportation and safehouses.  Meetings TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Meetings: A preplanned, coordinated event between two or more individuals. Meetings do not include all styles of communications. Rather, Meeting refers to a certain location at a certain date with specific individuals. Meetings infer the necessity of a decision, but the data does not specifically identify the decision or meeting subject.

For the purpose of this exercise, factions and offshoots will be considered separate from their parent organization in order to prevent from coding redundant ties. In other words, the most micro-level affiliations are coded while an individual is only coded in the parent organization if he or she is not listed as being affiliated with a component organization. Terrorist/insurgent affiliated organizations, such MMI and FPI, are also coded in this matrix.  Education (Schools) TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Educational Relations: Educational relations are defined as schools where individuals receive formal education, serve as an employee (teacher, admin etc.), and/or involved in additional educational or religious instruction at the institution.  Classmates FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Classmate Relations:Classmates/educational colleagues are defined as individuals who receive formal education, serve as an employee (teacher, admin etc.), and/or involved in additional educational or religious instruction at the same institution and at the same time. This relationship is more likely to reflect accurate relationships than the two-mode “Educational Affiliation” matrix since it considers the time in which individuals are present at a school.  Communication Ties FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Internal Communication: Internal communication is defined as the relaying of messages between individuals and/or groups inside the network through some sort of medium.  Kinship Ties FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Kinship: Kinship is defined as any family connection such as brother, brother-in-law, nephew etc. Kinship will also include current marriages and past marriages due to divorces and/or deaths.

Training does not include participation in a terrorist sponsored act or mujahedeen activity in places such as Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, or Iraq unless the individuals’ presence was to participate in a specifically designated training camp or base in one of these areas.  Business \u0026amp; Finance TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Business Relations: Defined as profit and non-profit organizations that employ people (includes Durassalam Foundation).  Operations TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Operations: Operational relations are defined as individuals who are knowingly involved in preparing, executing, and/or providing post-operation support. Preparation must directly relate to the operation and can include surveying targets, providing a safehouse for preparation, contributing to religious and/or physical training, and participating in a robbery where proceeds fund a subsequent attack. Providing post-operation support, such as hiding fugitives and disposing of explosives, must also be directly related to the operation.  Friendship Ties FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Friendship Relations: Friendship relations are defined as close attachments through affection or esteem between two people.
