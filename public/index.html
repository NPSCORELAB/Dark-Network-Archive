    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Researchers have increasingly turned to social network analysis (SNA) for gaining greater understanding of “dark networks,” that is, covert and illegal networks, such as terrorist groups and criminal gangs, which seek to conceal their activities from authorities.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, because data on dark networks is somewhat limited and often anecdotal, it is difficult to evaluate the various theories that researchers, academics, and subject matter experts have developed about what makes some dark networks successful and what the best intervention strategies are for disrupting them.</p>

<p>The only way to resolve these differences is for analysts to compare and contrast dark networks across time and space; only then can they identify those characteristics (e.g., level of centralization, cohesion) that tend to be associated with successful dark networks and those associated with unsuccessful ones. That is where the CORE Lab’s Dark Network Archive (CORE DNA) comes in.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Network approaches for analyzing narratives and other texts are being used with increasing frequency. They are seen as capable of identifying key actors and events, highlighting semantic structures, and uncovering underlying meanings and mental models. Numerous network approaches exist. In this paper, the authors adopt an approach where the characters in the story are nodes and the ties linking indicate some type of interaction between them. The authors explore the effects of tie strength between members of two “dark networks” found in the Harry Potter novels—Dumbledore’s Army and Voldemort’s Death Eaters. Drawing on centrality measures, this analysis finds that a handful of secondary characters play roles as important, or almost as important, as Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Moreover, a comparison of the topographical structure of the two networks suggests that if the fictional world of Harry Potter remotely mirrors the real one, Dumbledore’s Army is built to withstand stress and uncertainty, while the Death Eaters is not, suggesting that that J. K. Rowling has an intuitive understanding of a key difference between networks built on trust and those built on fear. The former live to fight another day; the latter do not.</p>

    <p>Social network research increasingly expands our understanding of the social environment of drug users&rsquo; health risks, particularly those associated with the transmission of HIV, hepatitis, and other sexually transmitted and bloodborne infectious diseases. Our study of the networks of drug users who use high-risk sites, where people gather to inject drugs and smoke crack cocaine, is designed to explore the relationships and interactions of drug users in settings in which potential risk occurs, and to assess the opportunity to create prevention linkages. This paper describes the ego-network characteristics and macro-network linkages among a sample of 293 drug users recruited through street outreach and personal drug-use network referral in Hartford, Connecticut. Characteristics of the largest connected component of the network are also described and analyzed. We discuss uses of network analyses as well as implications of network connections for peer-led AIDS prevention intervention conducted in high-risk drug-use sites.</p>

    <p>Network approaches for analyzing narratives and other texts are being used with increasing frequency. They are seen as capable of identifying key actors and events, highlighting semantic structures, and uncovering underlying meanings and mental models. Numerous network approaches exist. In this paper, the authors adopt an approach where the characters in the story are nodes and the ties linking indicate some type of interaction between them. The authors explore the effects of tie strength between members of two “dark networks” found in the Harry Potter novels—Dumbledore’s Army and Voldemort’s Death Eaters. Drawing on centrality measures, this analysis finds that a handful of secondary characters play roles as important, or almost as important, as Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Moreover, a comparison of the topographical structure of the two networks suggests that if the fictional world of Harry Potter remotely mirrors the real one, Dumbledore’s Army is built to withstand stress and uncertainty, while the Death Eaters is not, suggesting that that J. K. Rowling has an intuitive understanding of a key difference between networks built on trust and those built on fear. The former live to fight another day; the latter do not.</p>

    <p>Religiously motivated violence is and always will be a relevant topic. To address and effectively counter contemporary violent groups, it is important to investigate similar historic groups. This thesis attempts to answer the research question: &lsquo;During the Radical Reformation, why did some Anabaptist groups accept the use of violence while others did not, and how did the movement evolve to pacifism?&rsquo; To answer this question, this study utilizes a mixed methodology of case study analysis and social network analysis of Anabaptist leaders during the 16th century. This thesis argues that violent ideology is largely a function of three factors: charismatic leadership, isolation, and apocalypticism. The interaction of these factors led to the emergence of Anabaptist groups that embraced the use of violence. However, groups&rsquo; internal characteristics can also lead them away from violence. In the case of the Anabaptists, social proximity assisted leaders with a counter-message to speak effectively to violent ultra-radical factions. The goal of this thesis is to identify characteristics of religious groups that may signal the potential for future violence, while also providing insight into which leaders may be capable of re-directing groups that have become violent.</p>

    <p>The authors demostrate how social network topology can be inferred from following a limited observation of a large network. Essentially the issue is one of inferring the presence of links that are missed during a contrained data collection campaign on the network. It is particularly difficult to infer network structure for thos organizations that actively seek to remain covert and undetected. However, it is often very useful to know if two given individuals are likely to be connected even though limited surveillance efforts yield no evidence of a link. Specifically, the authors show how a statistical inference technique can be used to succesfully predict the existance of links that are missed during network sampling. The procedure is demostrated using data obtained from public source publications.</p>

    <p>Morselli&rsquo;s Project Siren data set encompasses actors embedded in an illicit network for the stolen-vehicle exportation (or ringing) operations. The data was obtained within a larger investigative setting between 1993 and 2005 under Project CERVO. As Morselli (2009) points out &lsquo;The main objective of this task force was to monitor and control the exportation of stolen luxury vehicles from the Port of Montreal. Cooperation between law-enforcement and border/insurance agencies was the unique feature, with the latter supplying documents from maritime shipping companies that contained information on suspect cargo and the identities of individuals or enterprises involved in their trasportation. The data presented here was reconstructed from Morselli&rsquo;s book by researchers and mainteners of the UCINET Software site (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware</a>). However, the author provides an in detail description of his data collection process on his 2000 book Inside Criminal Networks.</p>
