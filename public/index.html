    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Researchers have increasingly turned to social network analysis (SNA) for gaining greater understanding of “dark networks,” that is, covert and illegal networks, such as terrorist groups and criminal gangs, which seek to conceal their activities from authorities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because data on dark networks is somewhat limited and often anecdotal, it is difficult to evaluate the various theories that researchers, academics, and subject matter experts have developed about what makes some dark networks successful and what the best intervention strategies are for disrupting them.</p>
<p>The only way to resolve these differences is for analysts to compare and contrast dark networks across time and space; only then can they identify those characteristics (e.g., level of centralization, cohesion) that tend to be associated with successful dark networks and those associated with unsuccessful ones. That is where the CORE Lab’s Dark Network Archive (CORE DNA) comes in.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Historically, organized religion has been associated with large-scale cooperative activities- sometimes including the use of violence against groups of religious outsiders.  Originally used in the article, “Cultural inheritance or cultural diffusion of religious violence? A quantitative case study of the Radical Reformation,” (Matthews, Edmons, Wildman, Nunn, 2013), a network of sixteenth-century Anabaptist were created to understand how religious violence diffused through the congregations. Almost half of the congregations represented groups advocating for the use of violence to overthrow established churches and governments toward the ultimate goal of establishing Christian theocracies, with the other half being pacifists.  Actors and their stances on violence in the network were defined and coded based on their appearances within Anabaptist literature, and systematic collection of states for Anabaptist denominations.  The authors used a number of statistical analyses to determine that violent ideology may be learned independently from most other characteristics of an overall belief system, and/or may be determined more by congregationally inherited economic and political factors than by theology (Matthews, 2013). The data was expanded from 49 to 67 leaders with documented ties during its use in  “Factors of Religious Violence and Path to Peace: A Study of the 16th Century Anabaptists,” (McLaughlin, J 2015) to include Anabaptist and Prodestant leaders that were influential during the Protestant Reformation and the Radical Reformation that have documented interactions.  Documented interactions between individuals include instances of the actors meeting each other, or were in conversation, but in many cases, the leaders worked together, or went to school together. In other cases, they opposed one another in debates and were at total odds with one another.  McLaughlin determines through a variety of statistical methods that the propagation of theology that sanctions the use of violence was limited to a particular group of people with a particular set of beliefs associated with three factors: charismatic leadership, isolation, and apocalypticism, while also being strongly impacted by the theologies of emerging leaders.</p>

    <p>Social network research increasingly expands our understanding of the social environment of drug users&rsquo; health risks, particularly those associated with the transmission of HIV, hepatitis, and other sexually transmitted and bloodborne infectious diseases. Our study of the networks of drug users who use high-risk sites, where people gather to inject drugs and smoke crack cocaine, is designed to explore the relationships and interactions of drug users in settings in which potential risk occurs, and to assess the opportunity to create prevention linkages. This paper describes the ego-network characteristics and macro-network linkages among a sample of 293 drug users recruited through street outreach and personal drug-use network referral in Hartford, Connecticut. Characteristics of the largest connected component of the network are also described and analyzed. We discuss uses of network analyses as well as implications of network connections for peer-led AIDS prevention intervention conducted in high-risk drug-use sites.</p>

  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Network analysis has been recognized with increased frequency as a useful tool to understand narratives to identify key actors and events, highlighting semantic structures, and uncovering underlying concepts. In the article, Strong Ties and Where to Find Them: Or, Why Neville (and Ginny and Seamus) and Bellatrix (and Lucius) Might Be More Important than Harry and Tom (Everton, Everton, Green, Homblin, Schroeder, 2019), examines the two “dark networks” in the story, Dumbledore’s Army and Voldemort’s Death Eaters struggling for power.  As corresponding with this data set, Dumbledore’s Army is a resistance movement formed by students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in response to Voldemort’s Death Eaters terrorizing the wizarding world.  The network is evaluated by identifying the relationships that are present- ranging from casual acquaintances to kin and close friends that would die for one another.  The authors analyzed Dumbledore’s Army by using network topography and actor centrality metrics to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the network, and eventually comparing the results against Voldemort’s Death Eaters, who were examined in the same way.  The research concludes that Dumbledore’s Army is built on trust and mutual understanding of their cause, which increases network resiliency and is far more cohesive when compared to Voldemort’s Death Eaters. While also highlighting the importance of less central secondary characters in the success of the group despite their role on the periphery of the network.</p>

  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Despite acknowledgment of ‘hybrid’ street gangs in the literature, there is little systematic research into ethnic heterogeneity within gangs. This dataset was generated by researchers aiming at moving beyond the broad categorization of the Black street gang. For this purpose, they examine an all-Black Londonbased gang in detail, using fieldwork and police arrest data, and investigate the role of ethnic heterogeneity for the workings of the gang. Findings suggest that ethnic heterogeneity within this gang is crucial for its criminal operation. Although there is no evidence for ethnicity-related  specialization of crime, the structural co-offending pattern of the gang’s activities is dominated by ethnicity.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Religiously motivated violence is and always will be a relevant topic. To address and effectively counter contemporary violent groups, it is important to investigate similar historic groups. This thesis attempts to answer the research question: &lsquo;During the Radical Reformation, why did some Anabaptist groups accept the use of violence while others did not, and how did the movement evolve to pacifism?&rsquo; To answer this question, this study utilizes a mixed methodology of case study analysis and social network analysis of Anabaptist leaders during the 16th century. This thesis argues that violent ideology is largely a function of three factors: charismatic leadership, isolation, and apocalypticism. The interaction of these factors led to the emergence of Anabaptist groups that embraced the use of violence. However, groups&rsquo; internal characteristics can also lead them away from violence. In the case of the Anabaptists, social proximity assisted leaders with a counter-message to speak effectively to violent ultra-radical factions. The goal of this thesis is to identify characteristics of religious groups that may signal the potential for future violence, while also providing insight into which leaders may be capable of re-directing groups that have become violent.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Project Ciel is based on a small drug-importation network that was importing liquid hashish from Jamaica to Montreal. This network was targeted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Montreal Police from May 1996 to June 1997. Typical of many Canadian investigations of drug smuggling and trafficking, the operations in Project Ciel were described as taking place within a tightly governed organizational framework—a hierarchy, in short. Reports from the investigation maintained that the main target of the investigation was the “organizational leader.” Other key targets included the leader’s “lieutenant” and a series of other subordinates. The investigation produced three separate seizures, with two taking place at Mirabel airport near Montreal and another occurring at Sangster airport in Jamaica. Overall, 75 people fell into the surveillance net. A selection process that was aimed at identifying only those individuals who were active in the drug-importation operations resulted in a final network of 25 participants.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Morselli's Project Siren data set encompasses actors embedded in an illicit network for the stolen-vehicle exportation (or ringing) operations. The data was obtained within a larger investigative setting between 1993 and 2005 under Project CERVO. As Morselli (2009) points out &lsquo;The main objective of this task force was to monitor and control the exportation of stolen luxury vehicles from the Port of Montreal. Cooperation between law-enforcement and border/insurance agencies was the unique feature, with the latter supplying documents from maritime shipping companies that contained information on suspect cargo and the identities of individuals or enterprises involved in their trasportation. The data presented here was reconstructed from Morselli's book by researchers and mainteners of the UCINET Software site (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware)">https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware)</a>. However, the author provides an in detail description of his data collection process on his 2000 book Inside Criminal Networks.</p>

The two ICG reports on Noordin contain rich one- and two-mode data on a variety of relations and affiliations (friendship, kinship, meetings, etc.) along with significant attribute data (education, group membership, physical status, etc.). The data were initially structured and analyzed by Naval Postgraduate School students in the course “Tracking and Disrupting Dark Networks” under the direction of Professor Sean Everton, Co-Director of the CORE Lab and Professor Nancy Roberts and then expanded and cleaned by Associate Faculty for Instruction, Dan Cunningham.</p>
