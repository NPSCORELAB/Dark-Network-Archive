    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Researchers have increasingly turned to social network analysis (SNA) for gaining greater understanding of “dark networks,” that is, covert and illegal networks, such as terrorist groups and criminal gangs, which seek to conceal their activities from authorities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because data on dark networks is somewhat limited and often anecdotal, it is difficult to evaluate the various theories that researchers, academics, and subject matter experts have developed about what makes some dark networks successful and what the best intervention strategies are for disrupting them.</p>
<p>The only way to resolve these differences is for analysts to compare and contrast dark networks across time and space; only then can they identify those characteristics (e.g., level of centralization, cohesion) that tend to be associated with successful dark networks and those associated with unsuccessful ones. That is where the CORE Lab’s Dark Network Archive (CORE DNA) comes in.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>These data depict the network of individuals involved in the 2004 Australian Embassy Bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia. This incident was perpetrated by Jemaah Islamiyah, a terrorist organization linked to the 2002 Bali bombing, and claimed the lives of 9 people while injuring 150 others. The authors of these dataset, JJATT, gathered these data from using &lsquo;open source&rsquo; information. The present dataset reflects a combination of familial, friendship, and association relationships. As a dynamic dataset these relationships are depicted as subject to changes over time. The terrorist group, Jemaah Islamiyah, is a Southeast Asian militant extremist Islamist rebel group with ties to Al-Qaeda, that has committed numerous violent acts dedicated to the creation of an Islamic state in Southeast Asia.  The group has cells in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines, but remains particularly active in Indonesia where they maintain a public website.  The September 9th, 2004 suicide bombing of the Australian embassy resulted in the deaths of 9 individuals, with all Australians being reported alive.  Motivations for the September 9th, 2004 bombing of the Australian embassy are unclear, but possibly linked to the upcoming Indonesian presidential elections and/or the upcoming Australian elections, or the desired release of Abu Bakar Bashir, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. This was the third major attack targeting Australians in Indonesia, following the 2002 Bali bombing and 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta- both of which Jemaah Islamiyah has been suspected of orchestrating.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>These data depict the network of indiduals involved in the 2002 Bali bombings in the tourist district of Kuta on Bali, Indonesia. This incident claimed the lives of 202 people (including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, 23 Britons, and 20 more people of differing nationalities), and injuring 209 more individuals. The attack on October 12, 2002, has been attributed to Jemaah Islamiyah, a violent Islamist extremist group dedicated to the creation of an Islamic state in Southeast Asia that has links to Al-Qaeda. A suicide bomber detonated an explosive device inside of Paddy’s Pub, a local establishment popular with Australian and Western tourists, causing individuals to flee into the street where a second car bomb was detonated. A third device was detonated outside of the United States consulate in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia, but was significantly smaller and caused minimal damage and no deaths.  Motivation for the attack is believed to be in response to support for the United State’s War on Terror and Australia’s role in the liberation of East Timor. This was the first of a series of terrorist attacks committed by Jemaah Islamiyah targeting Australians and Westerners. The authors of this dataset, JJATT, gathered this data from using &lsquo;open source&rsquo; information. The present dataset reflects a combination of familial, friendship, and association relationships. As a dynamic dataset these relationships are depicted as dynamic and subject to changes over time.</p>

  <div class="article-style">
    <p>This data depicts the network of indiduals involved in the 2005 Bali bombings in the Kuta tourist district of Bali, Indonesia. This incident was perpetrated by Jemaah Islamiyah and al-Qaeda and claimed the lives of 23 people- including the bombers, and injuring more than 100. The suicide bombings occured at the the Raja’s Resturant at the Kuta Square shopping mall in central Kuta, and another two bombs detonated along the Jimbaran beach, one of which was near the Four Seasons Hotel- a location popular with Western tourists.  Three more undetonated bombs were found in Jimbaran.  Of the 23 killed, 19 Australians, 8 South Koreans, 6 Americans, 4 Japanese, 3 Canadians, and 1 Briton were killed.  Jemaah Islamiyah, a violent Islamic extremist group in Southeast Asia, has been attributed to the attacks.  The group also has ties to Al-Qaeda. Motivations for the attack are suggested to be associated with start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, and the upcoming third anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombing. This is the third of a series of terrorist bombings targeting Australians and Westerners in Bali, Indonesia.

    <p>Network analysis has been recognized with increased frequency as a useful tool to understand narratives to identify key actors and events, highlighting semantic structures, and uncovering underlying concepts. In the article, &lsquo;Strong Ties and Where to Find Them: Or, Why Neville (and Ginny and Seamus) and Bellatrix (and Lucius) Might Be More Important than Harry and Tom&rsquo; (Everton, Everton, Green, Homblin, Schroeder, 2019), examines the two &lsquo;dark networks&rsquo; in the story, Dumbledore&rsquo;s Army and Voldemort&rsquo;s Death Eaters struggling for power.  As corresponding with this data set, Voldemort&rsquo;s Death Eaters are a nefarious group that struggles to control the wizarding world through fear and terror, demanding unwavering legance to Voldemort and the Dark Arts, or use of dark magic.  Both networks are evaluated by identifying the relationships that are present- ranging from casual acquaintances to kin and close friends that would die for one another.  The authors analyzed Voldemort&rsquo;s Death Eaters by using network topography and actor centrality metrics to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the network, and eventually comparing the results against Voldemort&rsquo;s Death Eaters, who were examined in the same way.  The research concludes Voldemort&rsquo;s Death Eaters network is built on fear rather than trust, and far more fragmented than Dumbledore&rsquo;s Army- with Voldemort taking on an abnormally central role in the network that is ultimately detrimental to the resilience of the network, precluding to the fate of the Death Eaters during the final battle.</p>

  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Commonly when working with large social networks, data collection is limited by resources, time, and accessibility to the network leading connections to be missed.  As demonstrated in the article, Inferring missing links in partially observed social networks authored by CJ Rhodes and P Jones, it is possible to infer social network topology following a limited observation of a large network, despite data collection constraints.  Inferences can be made to determine where previously unconnected individuals are likely to fit, thereby attempting to predict network growth as new people are considered for inclusion.  The structure of a covert network or one that is actively trying to remain undetected can be even more difficult to ascertain.  However, as with the case of the 17 November Revolutionary Organization (N17), a militant Marxist urban guerrilla organization in Greece, it can be very useful to understand the likelihood that individuals are connected despite limited or no evidence of a link. The missing-links in the N17 network were reconstructed using a statistical procedure based on Bayes&rsquo; Theorem, using data derived from open-source reporting between 1975 to 2002, a time period in which the group was responsible for several violent acts such as assassinations, kidnappings, and symbolic attacks on government offices. The Bayesian approach used in this study determined the probability of an interaction between individuals based on a sample of their known relationships to other N17 associates when examined against their known relationships, role within the group, membership to factions, access to resources necessary to conduct group operations, and centrality (or importance) to the N17 network.  The results of the statistical analysis captures a predictive estimate of the possibility of connections between individuals that were not initially detected during the initial network sampling.  To increase confidence in the inference method, the study repeated the analysis on several other independent network samples drawn from the N17 data, ultimately exhibiting that there is a 50% probability that these predicted links are correct.</p>

    <p>This dataset refers to Paul Revere, who&rsquo;s role in the events leading up to the American revolution remains a matter of American mythology. For their part, analysts and historians have delved into this matter. In &lsquo;Paul Reverse&rsquo;s Ride&rsquo;, author David Fischer explores the historical events that lead up to the the emergence of the American republic. From this analysis, network researchers Han Shin-Kap, and Kieran Healy, have reconstructed networks from group membership to key Whig groups during this period of time. By recreating the social network of relationships relevant to the creation of the Sons of Liberty, Paul Revere’s revolutionary militia group located in Boston, researchers discerned the importance of Paul Revere’s brokerage role in the start of the revolution.  Through these network depictions, they have been able to address questions from a social structural perspective and answer questions on Revere&rsquo;s role in the mobilization process.</p>

Operation Vivace offers clear insight into the role of mosques in radicalization (Herrington, 2015). This failed incident resulted in the arrest and prosecution of the would be bombers, which yielded a great deal of information on the cell&rsquo;s activities.  The failed attacks have been claimed by a group Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade, named after one of Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s lieutenants who was killed in 2001- but the legitimacy of this is disputed.

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Historically, organized religion has been associated with large-scale cooperative activities- sometimes including the use of violence against groups of religious outsiders.  Originally used in the article, “Cultural inheritance or cultural diffusion of religious violence? A quantitative case study of the Radical Reformation,” (Matthews, Edmons, Wildman, Nunn, 2013), a network of sixteenth-century Anabaptist were created to understand how religious violence diffused through the congregations. Almost half of the congregations represented groups advocating for the use of violence to overthrow established churches and governments toward the ultimate goal of establishing Christian theocracies, with the other half being pacifists.  Actors and their stances on violence in the network were defined and coded based on their appearances within Anabaptist literature, and systematic collection of states for Anabaptist denominations.  The authors used a number of statistical analyses to determine that violent ideology may be learned independently from most other characteristics of an overall belief system, and/or may be determined more by congregationally inherited economic and political factors than by theology (Matthews, 2013). The data was expanded from 49 to 67 leaders with documented ties during its use in  “Factors of Religious Violence and Path to Peace: A Study of the 16th Century Anabaptists,” (McLaughlin, J 2015) to include Anabaptist and Prodestant leaders that were influential during the Protestant Reformation and the Radical Reformation that have documented interactions.  Documented interactions between individuals include instances of the actors meeting each other, or were in conversation, but in many cases, the leaders worked together, or went to school together. In other cases, they opposed one another in debates and were at total odds with one another.  McLaughlin determines through a variety of statistical methods that the propagation of theology that sanctions the use of violence was limited to a particular group of people with a particular set of beliefs associated with three factors: charismatic leadership, isolation, and apocalypticism, while also being strongly impacted by the theologies of emerging leaders.</p>
