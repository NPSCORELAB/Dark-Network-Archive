    <h2><a href="/post/australian_embassy_bombing_2004/">Australian Embassy Bombing 2004, Indonesia</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      These data depict the network of individuals involved in the 2004 Australian Embassy Bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia. This incident was perpetrated by Jemaah Islamiyah, a terrorist organization linked to the 2002 Bali bombing, and claimed the lives of 9 people while injuring 150 others. The authors of these dataset, JJATT, gathered these data from using 'open source' information. The present dataset reflects a combination of familial, friendship, and association relationships. As a dynamic dataset these relationships are depicted as subject to changes over time. The terrorist group, Jemaah Islamiyah, is a Southeast Asian militant extremist Islamist rebel group with ties to Al-Qaeda, that has committed numerous violent acts dedicated to the creation of an Islamic state in Southeast Asia.  The group has cells in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines, but remains particularly active in Indonesia where they maintain a public website.  The September 9th, 2004 suicide bombing of the Australian embassy resulted in the deaths of 9 individuals, with all Australians being reported alive.  Motivations for the September 9th, 2004 bombing of the Australian embassy are unclear, but possibly linked to the upcoming Indonesian presidential elections and/or the upcoming Australian elections, or the desired release of Abu Bakar Bashir, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. This was the third major attack targeting Australians in Indonesia, following the 2002 Bali bombing and 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta- both of which Jemaah Islamiyah has been suspected of orchestrating.

    <h2><a href="/post/bali_bombings_2002/">Bali bombings 2002, Indonesia</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      These data depict the network of indiduals involved in the 2002 Bali bombings in the tourist district of Kuta on Bali, Indonesia. This incident claimed the lives of 202 people (including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, 23 Britons, and 20 more people of differing nationalities), and injuring 209 more individuals. The attack on October 12, 2002, has been attributed to Jemaah Islamiyah, a violent Islamist extremist group dedicated to the creation of an Islamic state in Southeast Asia that has links to Al-Qaeda. A suicide bomber detonated an explosive device inside of Paddy’s Pub, a local establishment popular with Australian and Western tourists, causing individuals to flee into the street where a second car bomb was detonated. A third device was detonated outside of the United States consulate in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia, but was significantly smaller and caused minimal damage and no deaths.  Motivation for the attack is believed to be in response to support for the United State’s War on Terror and Australia’s role in the liberation of East Timor. This was the first of a series of terrorist attacks committed by Jemaah Islamiyah targeting Australians and Westerners. The authors of this dataset, JJATT, gathered this data from using 'open source' information. The present dataset reflects a combination of familial, friendship, and association relationships. As a dynamic dataset these relationships are depicted as dynamic and subject to changes over time.

This incident was perpetrated by Jemaah Islamiyah and al-Qaeda and claimed the lives of 23 people- including the bombers, and injuring more than 100. The suicide bombings occured at the the Raja’s Resturant at the Kuta Square shopping mall in central Kuta, and another two bombs detonated along the Jimbaran beach, one of which was near the Four Seasons Hotel- a location popular with Western tourists.  Three more undetonated bombs were found in Jimbaran.  Of the 23 killed, 19 Australians, 8 South Koreans, 6 Americans, 4 Japanese, 3 Canadians, and 1 Briton were killed.  Jemaah Islamiyah, a violent Islamic extremist group in Southeast Asia, has been attributed to the attacks.  The group also has ties to Al-Qaeda. Motivations for the attack are suggested to be associated with start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, and the upcoming third anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombing. This is the third of a series of terrorist bombings targeting Australians and Westerners in Bali, Indonesia. The authors of this dataset, JJATT, gathered this data from using 'open source' information. The present dataset reflects a combination of familial, friendship, and association relationships.
