summary: "These data refer to one of four illicit drug networks operating in Spain between 2007 and 2009. Operation ACERO (n=11) began in 2007 and involved a small family-based group. The group was composed mainly of members of a same family and was led by a female. They distributed cocaine in Madrid (Spain) that was provided to them by other groups based in a northwest region of the country, one of the most active areas in the provision of cocaine from the countries of origin. The group also had their own procedures to launder money."
