summary: "These data were drawn primarily from two International Crisis Group (ICG) reports: “Terrorism in Indonesia: Noordin’s Networks” (International Crisis Group, 2006) and “Indonesia: Noordin Top’s Support Base” (International Crisis Group, 2009). The two ICG reports on Noordin contain rich one- and two-mode data on a variety of relations and affiliations (friendship, kinship, meetings, etc.) along with significant attribute data (education, group membership, physical status, etc.). The data were initially structured and analyzed by Naval Postgraduate School students in the course “Tracking and Disrupting Dark Networks” under the direction of Professor Sean Everton, Co-Director of the CORE Lab and Professor Nancy Roberts and then expanded and cleaned by Associate Faculty for Instruction, Dan Cunningham.

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>These data were drawn primarily from two International Crisis Group (ICG) reports: “Terrorism in Indonesia: Noordin’s Networks” (International Crisis Group, 2006) and “Indonesia: Noordin Top’s Support Base” (International Crisis Group, 2009). The two ICG reports on Noordin contain rich one- and two-mode data on a variety of relations and affiliations (friendship, kinship, meetings, etc.) along with significant attribute data (education, group membership, physical status, etc.). The data were initially structured and analyzed by Naval Postgraduate School students in the course “Tracking and Disrupting Dark Networks” under the direction of Professor Sean Everton, Co-Director of the CORE Lab and Professor Nancy Roberts and then expanded and cleaned by Associate Faculty for Instruction, Dan Cunningham.</p>

For the purpose of this exercise, factions and offshoots will be considered separate from their parent organization in order to prevent from coding redundant ties. In other words, the most micro-level affiliations are coded while an individual is only coded in the parent organization if he or she is not listed as being affiliated with a component organization. Terrorist/insurgent affiliated organizations, such MMI and FPI, are also coded in this matrix.</td>

Preparation must directly relate to the operation and can include surveying targets, providing a safehouse for preparation, contributing to religious and/or physical training, and participating in a robbery where proceeds fund a subsequent attack. Providing post-operation support, such as hiding fugitives and disposing of explosives, must also be directly related to the operation.</td>

Religious study circles are only coded if they are separate from other religious entities (i.e. mosque). We do not include Islamic schools even though we assume that the schools have mosques. Not using the schools prevents duplication of effort with the team constructing the school ties. Additionally, we listed the mosques by the town in which it is located. If there was more than one in a city, we added a numerical identifier plus the name of nearest location.</td>
