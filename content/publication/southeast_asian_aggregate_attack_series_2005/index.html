Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) is a militant extremist Islamist group that aims to establish an Islamic state in Southeast Asia that has ties to Al-Qaeda.  JI has roots in Darul Islam, a radical Islamist/anti-colonialist movement in Indonesia in the 1940s.  The authors of this dataset, JJATT, gathered this data from using 'open source' information. The present dataset reflects a combination of familial, friendship, and association relationships. Furthermore, as a dynamic dataset these relationships are depicted as dynamic and subject to changes."

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>These data were made available through the John Jay &amp; ARTIS Transnational Terrorism Database (JJATT), which hosts a collection network datasets pertaining to radical Islamists and their associates who have directly contributed to a terrorist attack. The present data set represents the relationships between actors associated with Jemaah Islamiyah and involved in one or mulitiple terrorist incidents (e.g., Christmas Eve bombings in 2000, Philippines Ambassador Residence bombing in 2000, Bali bombings in 2002, Australian Embassy bombing in 2005, and Bali bombing in 2005). This undirected data is composed of 108 individuals and their relationships, involvement in one or more terrorist incidents, and legal status over time (1985-1989, 1990-1994, 1995-1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007). Relationships are coded into two categories: general relationships and kinship. General relationships are coded on a scale of 0-3; ‘0’ represents no relationship known, ‘1’ represents acquaintanceship or distant family ties, ‘2’ represents friendship or moderately close family ties, ‘3’ represents close friends or family. Coding of kinship is represented on a scale of 0-7; ‘0’ represents no kinship, ‘1’ represents in-laws, ‘2’ represents cousins, ‘3’ represents siblings, ‘4’ represents parent/child relationships, ‘5’ represents marriage, ‘6’ represents a grandparent/child relationship, and ‘7’ represents the relationship between significant others that are not married.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This network depicts a the ties between individuals associated with Jemaah Islamiyah and involed in one of the following events: Christmas Eve bombings in 2000, Philippines Ambassador Residence bombing in 2000, Bali bombings in 2002, Australian Embassy bombing in 2005, and Bali bombing in 2005. Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) is a militant extremist Islamist group that aims to establish an Islamic state in Southeast Asia that has ties to Al-Qaeda. JI has roots in Darul Islam, a radical Islamist/anti-colonialist movement in Indonesia in the 1940s. The authors of this dataset, JJATT, gathered this data from using ‘open source’ information. The present dataset reflects a combination of familial, friendship, and association relationships. Furthermore, as a dynamic dataset these relationships are depicted as dynamic and subject to changes.</p>
